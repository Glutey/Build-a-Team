# Build-a-Team

## User Story

As a manager a user want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that a user have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

Create, update and remove contact info for all members of your team. Allows a manager or employer to view information regarding their employees at a quick glance.
This program will prompt the user with a series of quesrtions about various team members. The user will be able to add and amend any combination of team members as they wish and have it populate a number of cards in an HTML document and view it via a server.

This is pretty sick and super useful for anyone wanting to be a Top G... trust me...
